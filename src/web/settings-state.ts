 * second case is what keeps an earlier save from being cleared by any later save
 * the user makes without touching that field.
 *
 * Three states share one flag map, and only these meanings are supported:
 * `true` the field is stored as a user override; `false` the user restored it, so
 * it must not be stored; an absent key the field is untouched. A `true` the snapshot
 * does not corroborate stores nothing: the map is a client signal for actions, and
 * the snapshot is the only record of what was actually written.
 *
 * A row the baseline does not carry is either brand new or absent from the saved
 * membership. There the editor's `true` is the only evidence of a user edit, and a
 * value discovery supplied without one stays the catalog's: adopting a discovered
 * model must not freeze the facts it was built from. A caller with no snapshot at
 * all must not call this: it has nothing to compare against and keeps the row's own
 * flags instead.

 * @param baseline - the same row in the last accepted snapshot, or undefined when that snapshot does not carry it.
